# DS1339 RTC
 DS1339 Real Time Clock Module
 
This is a basic implementation of the Maxim DS1339 Real Time Clock.  The I2C and Interrupt pins are all presented on a 6-pin header.  There is also a 2-pin header to allow for other sources of battery backup power should you not chose to use the CR1225 coin cell on the back.
